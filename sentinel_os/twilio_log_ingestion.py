Twilio Log Ingestion - Parse real IVR call logs

Converts actual Twilio call records into Iceberg call journeys with real friction

THE ivr_events INGESTION CONTRACT
----------------------------------
A bare Twilio Call record (sid/from/to/duration/status) carries no per-node
routing data -- there is no field on it that says which queue a caller
reached or how long they waited at each stop. Absent that, this module has
always had to guess: _reconstruct_journey picks a queue from the last digit
of the caller's phone number, and _extract_wait_times slices total call
duration into a fixed 0.1/0.5/0.4 ratio. Both are real, disclosed heuristics
(see their docstrings) and both now travel stamped ESTIMATED (event_v1.py) --
but a stamped guess is still a guess.

Fixing that for real means a genuinely different input: real per-node events
from wherever a caller's actual path is observed -- a Twilio Studio Flow
execution log, TaskRouter Task/Reservation events, a custom IVR application's
own Gather/Enqueue/Dequeue webhooks, or something else entirely. Which of
those a given deployment has is an integration decision, not a code decision,
so this module does not pick one. Instead it accepts a single generic shape
(IVRNodeEvent: node name + wait seconds + a source label) on the incoming
Twilio record, under the optional key "ivr_events". Whatever real system a
deployment wires up is responsible for translating its own events into that
shape; this module does not care which system it was.

If a record carries a valid ivr_events list, the journey and wait times come
from it directly and are stamped VERIFIED, with the method naming the
source label the caller supplied (so the ledger shows which real system
produced it, not just that it was "real"). If ivr_events is absent, nothing
about existing behavior changes: the phone-digit / ratio-split fallback runs
exactly as before, stamped ESTIMATED. If ivr_events is PRESENT but malformed
(missing node/wait_seconds/source, negative wait, empty list, an unrecognized
role), parsing fails loud rather than silently falling back -- a broken
real-data integration that quietly downgraded to guesses would be a worse
failure mode than an exception, the same fail-loud posture _count_friction
already takes on missing cassette thresholds.

NODE ROLES (2026-07-31): each event may optionally declare a `role` --
one of NODE_ROLE_QUEUE, NODE_ROLE_AGENT, NODE_ROLE_ESCALATION -- naming
what kind of stop this is, instead of requiring downstream code to guess
from the node's NAME (see the disclosed limitation this replaces, below).
Partial tagging is fine: an integration can tag only the stops it's sure
about and leave `role` unset on the rest -- each stop is judged on its own,
there is no all-or-nothing requirement across one call's events. A stop
with no role tag falls back to the existing name-convention guess for
THAT stop only. This module never invents a role for an event that didn't
declare one; it also never renames a node to match its role.

DISCLOSED LIMITATION, NOW PARTIALLY CLOSED (2026-07-31): the rest of the
pipeline (SentinelCore.infer_intent/prescribe_queue_reordering, the
production harness's queue detection, ObservePerceiveCore's resolution
detection) used to identify queue/agent stops ONLY by name convention --
a node counted as a queue stop only if "queue" was a substring of its
name, and only literal names in {agent_a, agent_b, agent_c, agent_d, ...}
counted as agent/resolution nodes (see observe_perceive_core.RESOLUTION_NODES).
Those checks now look for a role tag FIRST and fall back to the name
convention only when no tag is present, so a real event source no longer
has to rename its stops to match Sentinel's convention -- it can just
declare `role` on the events it's sure about. What's still true: a stop
with NO role tag is still only recognized by name, so a real source that
tags nothing gets the exact behavior this module always had.
